                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p class="textual">I'm Reham, a stay-at-home mom who is passionate about coding.<br />My journey started 7 months ago when I decided to start learning something I love while managing my house.<br />I dedicated a full time self-learning schedule to start learning the basics.<br />In those 7 months, I've been able to learn <b>SQL, R, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</b> and <b>Git</b> along with other non-coding technical skills like <b>Advanced Excel and Google Sheets</b>.<br /> Although I used to love my previous jobs in the banking sector, I've always felt that this was not where I belong.<br />My passion for computer and technology drove me all the way to this path and I'm really excited for the next step of my journey!</p>
